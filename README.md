ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Victor, nice to meet you.

Iâ€™m interested in learning about coding, focusing on data analises for bioinformatics studies and as gaming developing as a hobby.

Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of python.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on an any kind of begginer/introdutory level project, contact me.
